.SYNOPSIS
  Compiles Complexion's Papyrus scripts: the bridge and the natives' declarations.

.DESCRIPTION
  Compiles papyrus/ into build/papyrus/ against the reconstructed base sources and
  the import-only stubs in papyrus-stubs/ (LooksMenu's Overlays, MCM). Adapted from
  Silhouette's, which is known to work on this machine.

  NEVER compile into Data/Scripts. That directory is Vortex-deployed.

  ASCII only. Windows PowerShell 5.1 reads a BOM-less UTF-8 script as ANSI, and one
  non-ASCII character in a string is enough to turn this into a parse error that
  still exits 0.
