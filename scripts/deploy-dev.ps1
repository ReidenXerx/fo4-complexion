.SYNOPSIS
  Copies a complete Silhouette build into its Vortex staging folder.

.DESCRIPTION
  Vortex owns Data/, so the dev build is an ordinary Vortex mod, Silhouette-dev.
  Vortex deploys by HARDLINK: copying over a staged file changes the file the game
  reads at once, with no Deploy. So this refuses while the game runs -- it would
  change a running game's Data under it, and the DLL is held open anyway -- and it
  is ONE session's act: whoever holds the game says it is free first.

  What goes in, all of it built or generated, none of it hand-edited:
    build\<Config>\Silhouette.dll (+.pdb)  scripts\build-plugin.ps1
    build\papyrus\Silhouette\*.pex         scripts\build-papyrus.ps1
    data\...                               tools\silhouette_gen.py --write, tools\make_esp.py

  Refused before anything is copied: files the plugin's parser would refuse, a
  compiled player.pex of another generator run, a Silhouette.esp without the refit
  keyword (tools\make_esp.py --check: LooksMenu would move every refit value into
  her own body for good), files the verifier fails (tools\verify_bodygen.py -- it
  reads the built bodies in Data, so a body rebuilt since the generator ran fails
  here too), and a committed manifest edited or deleted (git; run from the
  fo4-silhouette checkout itself).

  Staged IN PLACE, file by file (Copy-Item -Force writes into the existing file and
  keeps its inode): every file Data already links goes live at once, all together.
  Removing and re-copying a folder instead made every restage half-deployed until
  the Deploy: a new esp and DLL beside the old scripts (wave 4). A file an older
  build shipped and this one does not is removed from staging (manifests excepted:
  they are only ever added), and the Deploy takes it out of Data. Every write is
  checked possible BEFORE the first one (a folder where a file goes, a file held
  open elsewhere), since a stop half-way leaves Data holding two builds.

  At the end, whether the Deploy is needed is read from -GameData: each staged file
  must be Data's very file (its hardlink), and nothing Silhouette no longer ships may
  be left there. What waits is listed by name.

  ASCII only. Windows PowerShell 5.1 reads a BOM-less UTF-8 script as ANSI.
